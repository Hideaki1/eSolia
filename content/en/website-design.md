## Your Website is Integral to Your Business

**_Or, at least it should be._** When you launch a website, it should actively market to help your business grow, and not just act as a static brochure. The benefits of a well-designed website are enormous, but the primary goal of a site launch is to make the right first impression immediately to visitors. Your corporate vision should be built directly in to how the site is designed and assembled, and be apparent to a visitor right away, either directly or subconsciously.
