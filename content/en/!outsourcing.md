## Why should you outsource?

One of the primary benefits is service continuity - hired or contracted individuals may be very good, but individuals move on, taking your system knowledge with them.

eSolia's support and engineering team "teamITMS" is focused on providing you with best practices for consistent quality engineering and support - leaving you more time to focus on your business.

### <i class="material-icons small">done</i> Outsourcing Benefits

* **Service continuity** - full ongoing maintenance of the outsourced operation's agreed service level.
